abstract = {Recent policy recommendations encourage parents to co-use media technology with their young children. However, we know little about what factors predict parents' co-use across the multiple types of media technology families own. Using a US nationally representative sample of 2,326 parents of children aged 8 and under, this study examines factors associated with parent–child co-use across six types of media: books, TV, computers, video games, tablets, and smartphones. Results indicate that parents are more likely to co-use traditional media such as books and television, whereas they are least likely to co-use video games. Results also suggest that media co-use may be a function of parental availability and parents' time spent with media, as well as parent demographics such as parents' age, gender, ethnicity, and level of education, and child demographics such as child age and gender. Results have implications for creating more targeted parental interventions to encourage media co-use.},

abstract = {Abstract The objective of this article is to fully understand Internet addiction, we aimed to compare the attachment styles and psychopathologies associated with problematic Internet use with those related to alcohol use. Through the participation of 141 male participants, the present study assessed problematic Internet and alcohol use, attachment, psychopathology, and demographic data via the use of self-rating questionnaires. We explored the significant predictors among avoidant and anxious attachments, depression, anxiety, and phobia to explain problematic Internet and alcohol use. The results showed that anxious attachment, depression, and anxiety could explain problematic alcohol use. In contrast, both anxious and avoidant attachment as well as depression and phobia explained problematic Internet use. Additionally, depression moderated the effects of avoidant attachment on problematic Internet use. We demonstrated that the interaction of attachment and psychopathology predicts problematic Internet us...},

abstract = {Im ersten Teil dieser explorativen Studie wird an einer Stichprobe von jungen Frauen (N = 225) die Konvergenz von insgesamt acht deutschsprachigen Bindungsinventaren untersucht. Dabei wird zwischen Bindungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen, die im engeren Sinne Aspekte von Bindung in aktuellen Bindungsbeziehungen erfassen, und Bedingungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen, die Aspekte von Bedingungen f{\"{u}}r die Entwicklung von Bindungsmustern retrospektiv erheben, unterschieden. Die Konvergenz wird sowohl auf der Ebene der Bindungs- bzw. Bedingungsskalen als auch auf der Ebene von in Clusteranalysen identifizierten Bindungs- bzw. Bedingungsmustern gepr{\"{u}}ft. Im zweiten Teil der Studie werden die Auspr{\"{a}}gungen in den Bindungs- und Bedingungsskalen und die Verteilungen der Bindungs- und Bedingungsmuster in einer Stichprobe von Frauen mit B.n. (N = 33) mit denen in einer hinsichtlich Alter, Partnersituation und Familienstand parallelisierten Stichprobe von Frauen ohne Essst{\"{o}}rungen und Adipositas verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Konvergenz zwischen den einzelnen Bindungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen in Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeit von ihrer Ausrichtung auf spezifische Bindungsbeziehungen und von den jeweils zugrundeliegenden theoretischen Konzepten zum einen stark variiert und zum anderen insgesamt schw{\"{a}}cher ist, als zu erwarten war. Die H{\"{o}}he der Korrelationen liegt selbst zwischen inhaltlich parallelen Skalen oft nur im m{\"{a}}{\ss}igen bis mittleren Bereich. In Faktorenanalysen auf Skalen- und Itemebene k{\"{o}}nnen gemeinsame zugrundeliegende Dimensionen von Bindung identifiziert werden. Allerdings erkl{\"{a}}ren diese gemeinsamen Dimensionen lediglich etwas mehr als 1/3 der Gesamtvarianz (Faktorenanalyse auf Itemebene). F{\"{u}}r jeden der eingesetzten Frageb{\"{o}}gen lassen sich {\"{u}}ber Clusteranalysen inhaltlich interpretierbare Bindungsmuster identifizieren. Die Konvergenz der Bindungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen auf Ebene dieser Bindungsmuster ist ebenfalls nur m{\"{a}}{\ss}ig ausgepr{\"{a}}gt. Die Bedingungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen konvergieren sowohl auf Skalenebene als auch auf der Ebene der beobachteten Muster st{\"{a}}rker als die Bindungsfrageb{\"{o}}gen miteinander. Auch f{\"{u}}r die Bedingungsskalen lassen sich {\"{u}}ber Faktorenanalysen zugrundeliegende Dimensionen und mittels Clusteranalysen {\"{u}}bergreifende Muster identifizieren. Schwache bis mittlere Korrelationen zwischen den mit Frageb{\"{o}}gen erhobenen Bindungsmerkmalen und Bindungsbedingungen zeigen, dass sich die auf Selbsteinsch{\"{a}}tzung beruhenden Bindungsmerkmale und – muster nur zu einem geringen Teil aus den retrospektiven Selbsteinsch{\"{a}}tzungen hinsichtlich der Bedingungen f{\"{u}}r die Entwicklung von Bindungsmustern vorhersagen lassen. Die mit Frageb{\"{o}}gen erfassten Bindungsmerkmale und Bindungsbedingungen der Frauen mit B.n. unterscheiden sich in mehreren Dimensionen deutlich von denen der Frauen ohne Essst{\"{o}}rungen und Adipositas. Frauen mit B.n. berichten {\"{u}}ber ein h{\"{o}}heres Ausma{\ss} an Angst und weniger Vertrauen und N{\"{a}}he in aktuellen Bindungsbeziehungen als Frauen ohne Essst{\"{o}}rungen. Es lassen sich nur wenig Frauen mit B.n. den sicheren Bindungsmustern zuordnen. Sie berichten h{\"{a}}ufiger als die Frauen der Vergleichsgruppe {\"{u}}ber Bindungsmuster, die im starken Ausma{\ss} durch Angst und das Vermeiden von N{\"{a}}he in Bindungsbeziehungen gekennzeichnet sind. Hinsichtlich ihrer Bindungsbedingungen berichten die Frauen mit B.n. {\"{u}}ber weniger elterliche F{\"{u}}rsorge und W{\"{a}}rme und mehr elterliche Kontrolle und {\"{U}}berbeh{\"{u}}tung w{\"{a}}hrend der Kindheit und Jugend als die Frauen der Vergleichsgruppe. Die Unterschiede werden in der retrospektiven Einsch{\"{a}}tzung der Beziehung zur Mutter deutlicher als in der Beurteilung der Beziehung zum Vater. Es lassen sich lediglich schwache bis mittlere Korrelationen zwischen den Auspr{\"{a}}gungen in den Bindungs- und Bedingungsskalen einerseits und den Auspr{\"{a}}gungen in den Skalen f{\"{u}}r problamatisches Essverhalten andererseits beobachten.},

It is hypothesized that background, adult-directed TV reduces the quantity and quality of parent language addressed to their young children. To test this hypothesis, the current study compared parent language directed at 12-, 24-, and 36-month-old toddlers (N = 49) in the presence and absence of background TV. In the presence of background TV, the number of words and utterances spoken per minute by the parent decreased as did the number of new words per minute. However, mean length of utterances did not differ. Because parent input is an important factor for language acquisition, development may be negatively affected by background TV exposure.},

With a particular focus on voices and issues from the Global South, the symposium addressed topics such as inequitable access, risks to safety and privacy, skills and digital literacy, spaces for participation, and civic engagement and innovation. The event also marked the launch of Digitally Connected — an initiative that brings together academics, practitioners, young people, activists, philanthropists, government officials, and representatives of technology companies from around the world who, together, are addressing the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. More information about the network (as well as the launch symposium) is available at http://www. digitallyconnected.org/about/. This book is one contribution by this growing, global network of collaborators and consists of two parts. The first part brings together a series of reflection pieces in the form of short essays written by friends and colleagues who attended the Digitally Connected symposium at Harvard University. The second part consists of a collection of stories, art, and digital media by youth about their experiences online. These creative pieces were submitted through an open call, which consisted of 10 prompts youth could reflect upon. The call can be found here: http://www.digitallyconnected.org/youth-art/ The contributions in this book reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that form the core and spirit of Digitally Connected. Some of the reflection pieces are closely connected to issues discussed at the symposium, others reflect more generally on personal observations and/or opinions, or highlight and discuss insights and learnings from specific studies or concrete projects. By making these reflection pieces and the youth work available to the expanding Digitally Connected network as well as the public at large, we hope to continue and further stimulate the global conversation about both the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. We hope you will join us in this conversation and collaborate with us to build a better world for — and together with — our children and young people.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of a common stressful event, i.e., academic examinations, on the 24-h mean concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and/or $\beta$-endorphin. In addition, we evaluated the effect of season on teh endocrine response to this stressor. We studied medical students (n = 55), screened for a variety of health and life style factors, from three consecutive medical school classes 1 month before, during, and 2 weeks following examinations. Hourly blood samples were obtained from an indwelling catheter and two serum pools were made (0800-2200h = day and 2300-0700 = night). Examinations produced a significant (p {\textless} .001){\_} increased in perceived stress scores. In addition, we found a significant (p {\textless} .001) effect of examination stress on the increase in mean daytime but not nocturnal ACTH levels during autumn, but not during the spring. In contrast, the examination stress did not significantly effect day or night mean cortisol levels from baseline to examination week. We further divided the students by whether their perceived stress scores increased during examination week and fell during recovery (Group 1) day or whether their perceived stress scores did not follow the expected pattern (Group 2). We found that in the Group 1 students who perceived the most stress, cortisol levels significantly increased (p {\textless} .001) from baseline to examination. Therefore, the nature of the stressor and the state of the responder were of equal importance in the observed cortisol response during examinations among these students. Further, academic stress had no significant effect on $\beta$-endorphin levels. Finally, we found that the mean day and night ACTH levels were higher (p {\textless} .001) in the spring than in the fall; a seasonal influence on cortisol and $\beta$-endorphin concentrations, however, was not observed. In summary, we have demonstrated that stress associated with the taking of examinations produces a dissociation among mean 24-h levels of ACTH, cortisol, and $\beta$-endorphin. In addition, daytime cortisol levels increased during examinations only in the group of students whose perceived stress scores increased. Further, a seasonal influence on ACTH secretion was suggested by these results with higher levels observed in the spring than in the fall. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {A 30-question Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) was validated, in Italian and English, among 230 subjects. Test—retest reliability was 0.82 for the General (past year or two) PSQ, while monthly Recent (past month) PSQs varied by a mean factor of 1.9 over 6 months; coefficient alpha {\textgreater} 0.9. General and/or Recent PSQ scores were associated with trait anxiety (r = 0.75), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (r = 0.73), depression (r = 0.56), self-rated stress (r = 0.56), and stressful life events (p {\textless} 0.05). The General PSQ was higher in in-patients than in out-patients (p {\textless} 0.05); both forms were correlated with a somatic complaints scale in a non-patient population (r {\textgreater} 0.5), and were higher, among 27 asymptomatic ulcerative colitis patients, in the seven who had rectal inflammation than in those with normal proctoscopy (p = 0.03).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study had two objectives. First, it addressed concern with the contribution of work stressors and resources to the development of back pain, over and above the influence of biomechanical work factors. Second, using recent models about the role of the sympathetic-adrenal medullar system in musculoskeletal problems as its basis, it tested whether low-back pain is associated with higher levels of catecholamines. METHODS: Altogether 114 nurses filled out a questionnaire in their first year of practice and again one year later. In addition, in a subsample of 24 nurses studied intensively at follow-up, urinary catecholamines were assessed at noon, before the end of work, in the evening, and at corresponding times on a day off. Daily stressful experiences and daily mood were also recorded. RESULTS: With control for baseline pain, biomechanical workload, and other potentially confounding variables, time control at the beginning of the study predicted low-back pain a year later. In the subsample, the epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were higher in those reporting more frequent episodes of back pain, the largest differences occurring at the end of work. In addition, control over stressful events at work was lower in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Time control is a risk factor for low-back pain among nurses beyond the influence of physical work load. Low control at work may increase the activity of the sympathetic-adrenal medullar system, which seems to play an important role in the development of musculoskeletal pain.},

abstract = {A basic principle of attachment theory is that early attachment relationships with caregivers provide the prototype for later social relations. Working within an attachment framework, a new 4-group model of characteristic attachment styles in adulthood is proposed. In particular, two forms of adult avoidance of intimacy are differentiated: a fearful style that is characterized by a conscious desire for social contact which is inhibited by fears of its consequences, and a dismissing style that is characterized by a defensive denial of the need or desire for greater social contact. This distinction corresponds to two differing models of the self: people who fearfully avoid intimacy view themselves as undeserving of the love and support of others, and people who dismiss intimacy possess a positive model of the self that minimizes the subjective awareness of distress or social needs. The emotional and interpersonal ramifications of the two proposed styles of adult avoidance are discussed.},

One was to investigate the relationship between risk of smartphone addiction and satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance. The other aim was to explore whether satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance facilitates smartphone addiction. To identify test subjects, systematic random sampling was implemented. A total of 300 university students completed an online survey questionnaire that was posted to the student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to scales including the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Data analyses included Pearson correlations between the main variables and multivariate analysis of variances. The results showed that smartphone addiction risk was positively related to perceived stress, but the latter was negatively related to satisfaction with life.

abstract = {This study examined the effects of perceived stress and related individual characteristics, mood states, and stressful daily events on salivary cortisol levels. Forty-one "high stress" and 46 "low stress" subjects were selected on the basis of Perceived Stress Scale scores from a sample of male, white collar workers. Subjects completed Experience Sampling self-reports and collected saliva samples 10 times a day over 5 consecutive days. Multilevel analysis revealed that trait anxiety and depression, but not perceived stress, were associated with small but statistically significant cortisol elevation. No effects on cortisol were found for recent life events, chronic difficulties, trait anger, or psychosomatic symptoms. Distress, as reflected by the mood states Negative Affect and Agitation, was associated with higher cortisol levels, whereas Positive Affect had no statistically significant effect. Stressful daily events were associated with increased cortisol secretion, the magnitude of the effect depending on whether the event was still ongoing and on how frequently a similar kind of event had occurred previously. Although perceived stress, anxiety, and depression did not increase cortisol reactivity to daily events, we found evidence for reduced habituation to recurrent events in subjects scoring high on these traits. Mood appeared to play a mediating role in the relationship between stressful events and cortisol secretion. These results suggest that negative affectivity is not just a confounder but is related to elevated cortisol secretion during normal daily activities. The finding that even minor events and fluctuations in mood states were associated with increased adrenocortical activity points to a possible mechanism linking subjective experience to health outcomes.},

@article{Main1985,
abstract = {Research guided by attachment theory as formulated by Bowlby and Ainsworth is branching out in exciting new directions. The 12 chapters collected together in this Monograph present theoretical and methodological tools that will facilitate further research on attachment across the life span, across generations, and across cultures. The Monograph is divided into 4 parts. Part 1 provides the theoretical framework, emphasizing the ethological and the psychoanalytic roots of attachment theory. Two central ideas in attachment theory are highlighted: attachment as grounded in a behavioral-motivational control system whose set-goal is felt security, and the notion that individuals construct internal working models of self and attachment figures that guide the interpretation and production of behavior. These themes are repeatedly taken up in other chapters of the Monograph. Part 2 is concerned with translating theory into measurement. In Chapter II, Waters and Deane present a Q-sort suitable for assessing attachment security in 12-36-month-olds. This instrument is based on Bowlby's control systems model of attachment. In Chapter III, Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy offer a variety of highly original measures for assessing security in children and adults that have been validated against attachment classifications in infancy. These measures open new avenues for research by moving the study of attachment to the level of representation. Part 3 (Chaps. IV-IX) is organized around issues in adaptation, maladaptation, and intergenerational transmission. Vaughn, Deane, and Waters (Chap. IV) examine short-term and long-term adaptations to nonmaternal care. Findings on short-term adaptation to high-quality day care seemed benign; those on long-term adaptation illustrate that outcome is jointly dependent on attachment security and on whether or when the mother returns to work. In Chapter V, Dontas, Maratos, Fafoutis, and Karangelis present a field study, conducted in a model infant home in Greece, describing 8-12-month-olds' 2-week adaptations to a new principal caregiver (the adoptive mother) in a supportive setting. The theme of Chapters VI and VII is continuity of adaptation from infancy to early childhood in a poverty and in a middle-class sample. Significant relationships between early insecure attachment classification and later preschool behavior problems are reported for the poverty sample (Erickson, Sroufe, {\&} Egeland, Chap. VI) but not for the middle-class sample (Bates, Maslin, {\&} Frankel, Chap. VII), despite the fact that mother-infant interaction at 6, 13, and 24 months was related to attachment classifications in predictable ways. In Chapter VIII, Schneider-Rosen, Braunwald, Carlson, and Cicchetti discuss infants' adaption to maltreatment. They report a preponderance of insecure attachment classifications at 12, 18, and 24 months, with avoidant classifications becoming dominant at the later ages. Secure attachment in abused children is explained in terms of multifactorial compensatory and potentiating influences. In the concluding chapter of this section, Ricks reviews intergenerational effects related to attachment. Two domains are considered: effects of early separation and familial disruption on parental behavior in the next generation, and continuity in quality of attachment. Part 4 (Chaps. X-XII) is devoted to cross-national research on attachment in infancy. Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, and Unzner (Chap. X) present findings for North German mother-infant pairs, observed at home and in the Strange Situation. This first attempt at replicating the classic Baltimore study corroborated associations between Strange Situation classifications and maternal sensitivity to infant signals reported by Ainsworth and her colleagues. However, the overrepresentation of group A (avoidant) classifications in this sample is ascribed to a culturally valued emphasis on early independence rather than to maternal rejection. In Chapter XI, Sagi, Lamb, Lewkowicz, Shoham, Dvir, and Estes report a high proportion of insecure-resistant (C) classifications in 12-month-old Israeli kibbutz infants, who were observed with mother, father, and metapelet. This finding is explained in terms of heightened stranger anxiety rather than insecurity. A comparison group of Israeli city infants in day care resembled U.S. samples in terms of Strange Situation groups. The insecure-resistant group (C) was also overrepresented in Japan (Miyake, Chen, {\&} Campos, Chap. XII), where C classification was correlated with neonatal temperament but also with maternal interactive behavior. In view of the infants' lack of experience with nonfamilial care, the C classification in Japan is not interpreted as an index of insecure-resistant attachment. Two additional themes running through the Monograph deserve special mention. These are (a) a concern with epigenetic explanations, charting different developmental pathways for secure and insecure infants, and (b) consideration of exceptional cases that do not, at first sight, fit predictions derived from the epigenetic perspective.},

abstract = {Parents, teachers, pediatricians and other child health professionals face the challenge of widespread1 , increasing2 and multipurpose3 use of touchscreens. Even toddlers are accessing technologies such as tablets, smartphones, iTouch and other mobile devices with increasing frequency. Child use of this engaging technology is associated with diverse beliefs and practices on the part of parents, motivated by what is best for the child and by the difficulty of limiting touchscreen use4 . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 20165 ) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of technology is beneficial for children under 18‐24 months and recommends that screen media be discouraged for this age group. Toddler use of touchscreens has exploded nonetheless and child health professionals and educators require a more adequate research base to confidently communicate recommendations to parents. Yet, as with any innovative technology intervention, a key research challenge relates to building a longitudinal evidence base with a rapidly evolving hardware features and functionalities, necessitating repeated research studies. This short narrative review builds on a recent summary of the field6 and broader recommendations concerning all screens and screen time more generally7,8 to propose a guiding framework concerning touchscreens and children aged under two years. The aim is to support health professionals, researchers, educators and advocates, in their discussions with parents about touchscreens' use with children under two years. There are four inter‐related factors in this framework: research, content, context and developmental issues. There is no specific order to these four factors, and some are more related to each other than others, depending on the circumstances. We review the literature according to the four factors with the purpose of providing a clear view on the area of interest and at the same time, highlighting that the four issues constitute one framework that, as a whole, needs to guide future research, practice and thinking in this area.},

Design Longitudinal analysis of 259 mother-infant dyads participating in a long-term study related to early child development, from November 23, 2005, through January 14, 2008. Setting An urban public hospital. Participants Mothers with low socioeconomic status and their infants. Main Exposure Duration and content of media exposure at age 6 months. Main Outcome Measures Cognitive and language development at age 14 months. Results Of 259 infants, 249 (96.1{\%}) were exposed to media at age 6 months, with mean (SD) total exposure of 152.7 (124.5) min/d. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, duration of media exposure at age 6 months was associated with lower cognitive development at age 14 months (unadjusted:r = −0.17,P {\textless} .01; adjusted: $\beta$ = −0.15,P = .02) and lower language development (r = −0.16,P {\textless} .01; $\beta$ = −0.16,P {\textless} .01). Of 3 types of content assessed, only 1 (older child/adult–oriented) was associated with lower cognitive and language development at age 14 months. No significant associations were seen with exposure to young child–oriented educational or noneducational content. Conclusions This study is the first, to our knowledge, to have longitudinally assessed associations between media exposure in infancy and subsequent developmental outcomes in children from families with low socioeconomic status in the United States. Findings provide strong evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations of no media exposure prior to age 2 years, although further research is needed.},

We examine the link between psychological traits and the compulsive behaviors of smartphone users, and look further into the stress caused by those compulsive behaviors. We conducted an empirical study consisting of 325 participants and compared Structural Equation Modeling with competing models. The results suggest that compulsive usage of smartphone and technostress are positively related to psychological traits including locus of control, social interaction anxiety, materialism and the need for touch. Gender differences are also found in the aforementioned relationships. The results have practical implications to user-oriented smartphone design and operation companies as well as government agencies as they combat the social ills brought on by smartphones. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Enhancing Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit goal for individuals, communities, nations, and the world. But defining QOL and measuring progress toward meeting this goal have been elusive. Diverse “objective” and “subjective” indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on subjective well-being (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred interest. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we present an integrative definition of QOL that combines measures of human needs with subjective well-being or happiness. QOL is proposed as a multi-scale, multi-dimensional concept that contains interacting objective and subjective elements. We relate QOL to the opportunities that are provided to meet human needs in the forms of built, human, social and natural capital (in addition to time) and the policy options that are available to enhance these opportunities. Issues related to defining, measuring, and scaling these concepts are discussed, and a research agenda is elaborated. Policy implications include strategies for investing in opportunities to maximize QOL enhancement at the individual, community, and national scales.},

There is evidence that parent television use is associated with higher levels of child television time, but we know little about what predicts children's media use with other technology. Using a nationally representative sample of more than 2300 parents of children ages 0-8, children's time spent with four digital media devices - television, computers, smartphones, and tablet computers - was examined. Results from linear regression analyses indicate across all four platforms that parents' own screen time was strongly associated with child screen time. Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes. Results suggest that policymakers should consider the family environment as a whole when developing policy to influence children's screen media use at home.},

Methods: 941 individuals completed anonymously questionnaires comprising of PSS, the Depression Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21 version), and a list of stress-related symptoms. Psychometric properties of PSS were investigated by confirmatory factor analysis (construct validity), Cronbach's alpha (reliability), and by investigating relations with the DASS-21 scores and the number of symptoms, across individuals' characteristics. The two-factor structure of PSS-10 and PSS-14 was confirmed in our analysis. We found satisfactory Cronbach's alpha values (0.82 for the full scale) for PSS-14 and PSS-10 and marginal satisfactory values for PSS-4 (0.69). PSS score exhibited high correlation coefficients with DASS-21 subscales scores, meaning stress (r = 0.64), depression (r = 0.61), and anxiety (r = 0.54). Women reported significantly more stress compared to men and divorced or widows compared to married or singled only. A strong significant (p {\textless} 0.001) positive correlation between the stress score and the number of self-reported symptoms was also noted.

abstract = {This paper offers a new characterisation of young children's (2–8 years) reading for pleasure (RfP) with digital books. This characterisation is rooted in a re-contextualisation of Anna Craft's conceptualisation of twenty-first century childhoods in Creativity and education futures (Stoke on Trent, Trentham, 2011) and a review of the literature concerning young children's RfP with digital books. The paper develops Craft's (2011) work by considering the ways in which digital books can resource the ‘4Ps of digital childhood' in reading for pleasure. Six facets of reader engagement, nested within Craft's (2011) 4Ps, are presented: affective, creative, interactive, shared, sustained and personalised reading engagements. It is argued that this characterisation of young children's reading engagements can enrich our understanding of the affordances of digital books in relation to RfP in the twenty-first century. The paper thus offers an important new contribution, going beyond established work in the field, which typically explores digital books in relation to children's learning, product design or developmental outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education},

Ninety parents of three- to six-year-olds, recruited from a relatively economically advantaged area in the United Kingdom, completed a media opinion survey. Although traditional television remains the favourite type of media platform among young children, touchscreen devices are gaining in popularity, and may promote simultaneous multi-screen use. Moreover, parents believe that the effects of media on developmental outcomes are generally positive. However, they do monitor the content of traditional and new media their children are exposed to. This study shows an emerging evidence of concurrent multi-screen use among very young children. More detailed examination of early media multitasking, and its relationship to cognitive and behavioural outcomes, is necessary.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Television and video/DVD viewing among very young children has become both pervasive and heavy. Previous studies have reported an association between early media exposure and problems with attention regulation but did not have data on the content type that children watched. We tested the hypothesis that early television viewing of 3 content types is associated with subsequent attentional problems. The 3 different content types are educational, nonviolent entertainment, and violent entertainment. METHODS Participants were children in a nationally representative sample collected in 1997 and reassessed in 2002. The analysis was a logistic regression of a high score on a validated parent-reported measure of attentional problems, regressed on early television exposure by content and several important sociodemographic control variables. RESULTS Viewing of educational television before age 3 was not associated with attentional problems 5 years later. However, viewing of either violent or non-violent entertainment television before age 3 was significantly associated with subsequent attentional problems, and the magnitude of the association was large. Viewing of any content type at ages 4 to 5 was not associated with subsequent problems. CONCLUSIONS The association between early television viewing and subsequent attentional problems is specific to noneducational viewing and to viewing before age 3.},

abstract = {The quality of life (QOL) construct has a complex composition, so it is not surprising that there is neither an agreed definition nor a standard form of measurement. This is not due to a lack of ideas. The Directory of Instruments (http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/acqol/instruments/index.htm), produced by the Australian Centre on Quality of Life, describes over 800 instruments which purport to measure life quality in some form, with each one containing an idiosyncratic mixture of dependent variables. It is notable, however, that many of these instruments have been developed for highly selected groups in the population; particularly in regard to scales devised to monitor QOL in the context of medical conditions or disability. Such scales are unsuitable for use with the general population. Moreover, most scales devised for use with the general population cannot be used with all population sub-sets, such as people with cognitive impairment and children. These are important limitations since it means that the QOL experienced by minority groups cannot be norm-referenced back to the general population. A further concern is that many QOL instruments fail to make a clear distinction between the objective and subjective dimensions of life quality. This violates the fundamental principle that objective and subjective dimensions are separate entities that normally bear little or no relationship to one another, and so must be separately measured. With these issues in mind, the Personal Wellbeing Index has been developed to measure the subjective dimension of QOL – Subjective Wellbeing.},

We aimed to discover if there was an interaction between parental use of smart technologies, parents' attitudes and the child's age that would predict young children's usage of smart devices. We also wanted to find out what kinds of devices are made available for 0–3-year olds, how frequently parents allow the child to use them, the activities children are engaged in on smart devices and which apps they use during their digital play. Parental mediation practices were also analysed. Our results provide evidence that parent screen time, parent attitudes and the child's age are all associated with touch screen use among infants and toddlers. Parents give three main reasons when rationalising their child's touch screen use, related to education, entertainment and behaviour regulation.

abstract = {In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement addressing media use in children. The purpose of that statement was to educate parents about the effects that media--both the amount and the content--may have on children. In one part of that statement, the AAP recommended that "pediatricians should urge parents to avoid television viewing for children under the age of two years." The wording of the policy specifically discouraged media use in this age group, although it is frequently misquoted by media outlets as no media exposure in this age group. The AAP believed that there were significantly more potential negative effects of media than positive ones for this age group and, thus, advised families to thoughtfully consider media use for infants. This policy statement reaffirms the 1999 statement with respect to media use in infants and children younger than 2 years and provides updated research findings to support it. This statement addresses (1) the lack of evidence supporting educational or developmental benefits for media use by children younger than 2 years, (2) the potential adverse health and developmental effects of media use by children younger than 2 years, and (3) adverse effects of parental media use (background media) on children younger than 2 years.},

Operation definitions of emotion are presented, and structural and functional approaches to the study of emotional development are discussed. Other areas discussed include continuity and change in emotions from infancy through adolescence, and how emotions are related to positive development. Factors affecting the promotion of positive emotional development include promoting positive affect, promoting emotion understanding, and promoting emotional regulation. It is suggested that in order to address limitations of the current knowledge base, integration of research across multiple domains, including the physiological system, cognitive structures and the self-system, will be necessary.

abstract = {In two surveys of adult consumers, we find that attachment styles predict consumers' reactions after brand relationships end. Specifically, 'fearful' consumers—those high in both attachment anxiety and avoidance—are most likely to complain to third parties, to obsess about harming the brand, and to report seeking payback against brands. Two factors mediate the effect of attachment on reactions: threats to consumers' self-image and the loss of benefits from their relationship. This is consistent with the explanation we propose: specifically, fearful individuals invest in and depend more on consumption relationships and, therefore, lose more when such relationships end.},

This study was designed to demonstrate how parenting styles in relation to Internet use are perceived by children and parents and how these styles affect children's Internet use. Both qualitative and quantitative data-collection techniques were used in the study. The quantitative data-collection process was carried out through the participation of 1289 students, and the qualitative data-collection process was carried out with 20 parents and 23 children. The result of the study showed that the Internet parenting styles could be categorized as laissez-faire, permissive, authoritative, and authoritarian. A significant relationship was shown between Internet parenting style and child's gender and mothers' education level. It was also found that as the students' age and grade level increased, Internet parenting styles that were interpreted as initially authoritative were later interpreted as laissez-faire. As the grade level increased, the Internet parenting style tended to lean toward laissez-faire.},

Sixty-three individuals (M = 63 years) completed measures of parental child-rearing practices and trait emotion; they also completed a storytelling task and an emotion decoding task and were videotaped during an emotion induction procedure for later facial coding. Attachment patterns were assessed using a semi-structured interview and a four-category coding system. Multiple regression was applied to the data to test attachment models.Analyses based on theoretical models accounted for 23–47{\%} of the variance in attachment patterns. Alternative, empirical models, developed on the basis of observed bivariate associations, resulted in the improvement of three models.

All factor analytic structures are based on the same measuring instrument, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, {\&} Brown, 1996). Following a "walk" through the general process of CFA modeling, I identify several common misconceptions and improper application practices with respect to both EFA and CFA and tender caveats with a view to preventing further proliferation of these pervasive practices.},

abstract = {Research examining the development of online addictions has grown greatly over the last decade with many studies suggesting both risk factors and protective factors. In an attempt to integrate the theories of attachment and identity formation, the present study investigated the extent to which identity styles and attachment orientations account for three types of online addiction (i.e., internet addiction, online gaming addiction, and social media addiction). The sample comprised 712 Italian students (381 males and 331 females) recruited from schools and universities who completed an offline self-report questionnaire. The findings showed that addictions to the internet, online gaming, and social media were interrelated and were predicted by common underlying risk and protective factors. Among identity styles, ‘informational' and ‘diffuse-avoidant' styles were risk factors, whereas ‘normative' style was a protective factor. Among attachment dimensions, the ‘secure' attachment orientation negative- ly predicted the three online addictions, and a different pattern of causal relationships were observed between the styles underlying ‘anxious' and ‘avoidant' attachment orientations. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that identity styles explained between 21.2 and 30{\%} of the variance in online addictions, whereas attachment styles incrementally explained between 9.2 and 14{\%} of the variance in the scores on the three addiction scales. These findings highlight the important role played by identity formation in the development of online addictions},

abstract = {Positive education is defined as education for both traditional skills and for happiness. The high prevalence worldwide of depression among young people, the small rise in life satisfaction, and the synergy between learning and positive emotion all argue that the skills for happiness should be taught in school. There is substantial evidence from well controlled studies that skills that increase resilience, positive emotion, engagement and meaning can be taught to schoolchildren. We present the story of teaching these skills to an entire school—Geelong Grammar School—in Australia, and we speculate that positive education will form the basis of a ‘new prosperity', a politics that values both wealth and well‐being.},

abstract = {This paper presents evidence from three samples, two of college students and one of participants in a community smoking-cessation program, for the reliability and validity of a 14-item instrument, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},

With a particular focus on voices and issues from the Global South, the symposium addressed topics such as inequitable access, risks to safety and privacy, skills and digital literacy, spaces for participation, and civic engagement and innovation. The event also marked the launch of Digitally Connected — an initiative that brings together academics, practitioners, young people, activists, philanthropists, government officials, and representatives of technology companies from around the world who, together, are addressing the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. More information about the network (as well as the launch symposium) is available at http://www. digitallyconnected.org/about/. This book is one contribution by this growing, global network of collaborators and consists of two parts. The first part brings together a series of reflection pieces in the form of short essays written by friends and colleagues who attended the Digitally Connected symposium at Harvard University. The second part consists of a collection of stories, art, and digital media by youth about their experiences online. These creative pieces were submitted through an open call, which consisted of 10 prompts youth could reflect upon. The call can be found here: http://www.digitallyconnected.org/youth-art/ The contributions in this book reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that form the core and spirit of Digitally Connected. Some of the reflection pieces are closely connected to issues discussed at the symposium, others reflect more generally on personal observations and/or opinions, or highlight and discuss insights and learnings from specific studies or concrete projects. By making these reflection pieces and the youth work available to the expanding Digitally Connected network as well as the public at large, we hope to continue and further stimulate the global conversation about both the challenges and opportunities children and youth encounter in the digital environment. We hope you will join us in this conversation and collaborate with us to build a better world for — and together with — our children and young people.},

abstract = {BackgroundMental stress and emotion have long been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in animal models and humans. The effect of mental challenge on ventricular action potential duration (APD) in conscious healthy humans has not been reported. Methods and ResultsActivation recovery intervals (ARI) measured from unipolar electrograms as a surrogate for APD (n=19) were recorded from right and left ventricular endocardium during steady state pacing while subjects watched an emotionally charged film clip. To assess the possible modulating role of altered respiration on APD, the subjects then repeated the same breathing pattern they had during the stress, but without the movie clip. Haemodynamic parameters (mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, and rate of pressure increase) and respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (p=0.001). APD decreased during the stressful parts of the film clip, eg for global RV ARI at end of film clip 193.8ms (SD 14) vs 198.0ms (SD13) during the matched breathing control (end film LV 199.8ms (SD16) vs control 201.6ms (SD15), p=0.004. Respiration rate increased during the stressful part of the film clip (by 2 breaths/minute), and was well matched in the respective control period without any haemodynamic or ARI changes. ConclusionsOur results document for the first time direct recordings of the effect of a mental challenge protocol on ventricular action potential duration in conscious humans. The effect of mental challenge on APD was not secondary to emotionally-induced altered respiration or heart rate.},

@article{Bell1972,
abstract = {This naturalistic, longitudinal study of 26 infant-mother pairs shows that consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. By the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Close physical contact is the most frequent maternal intervention and the most effective in terminating crying. Nevertheless, maternal effectiveness in terminating crying was found to be less powerful than promptness of response in reducing crying in subsequent months. Evidence suggests that whereas crying is expressive at first, it can later be a mode of communication directed specifically toward the mother. The development of noncrying modes of communication, as well as a decline in crying, is associated with maternal responsiveness to infant signals. The findings are discussed in an evolutionary context, and with reference to the popular belief that to respond to his cries "spoils" a baby.},

abstract = {Parents, teachers, pediatricians and other child health professionals face the challenge of widespread1 , increasing2 and multipurpose3 use of touchscreens. Even toddlers are accessing technologies such as tablets, smartphones, iTouch and other mobile devices with increasing frequency. Child use of this engaging technology is associated with diverse beliefs and practices on the part of parents, motivated by what is best for the child and by the difficulty of limiting touchscreen use4 . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 20165 ) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of technology is beneficial for children under 18‐24 months and recommends that screen media be discouraged for this age group. Toddler use of touchscreens has exploded nonetheless and child health professionals and educators require a more adequate research base to confidently communicate recommendations to parents. Yet, as with any innovative technology intervention, a key research challenge relates to building a longitudinal evidence base with a rapidly evolving hardware features and functionalities, necessitating repeated research studies. This short narrative review builds on a recent summary of the field6 and broader recommendations concerning all screens and screen time more generally7,8 to propose a guiding framework concerning touchscreens and children aged under two years. The aim is to support health professionals, researchers, educators and advocates, in their discussions with parents about touchscreens' use with children under two years. There are four inter‐related factors in this framework: research, content, context and developmental issues. There is no specific order to these four factors, and some are more related to each other than others, depending on the circumstances. We review the literature according to the four factors with the purpose of providing a clear view on the area of interest and at the same time, highlighting that the four issues constitute one framework that, as a whole, needs to guide future research, practice and thinking in this area.},

abstract = {This editorial discusses the difference made by 'the digital' to children's experiences of risk. In Brindova et al.'s (2014) article in this issue, a large-scale correlational study sets up just the puzzle: watching television for more than 3 h per day is correlated with a host of adverse symptoms (headaches, irritability, and depression). The authors complicate the story by showing what many have suspected, namely a curvilinear relation between, in this case, amount of online communication and life satisfaction. To resolve the correlation/cause problem in a domain where one can hardly experiment with teenagers' lives, longitudinal research is helpful. The authors report that higher use of mobile phones and television viewing is associated, 1 year later, with greater levels of depression among teenagers. This seems to establish the case for media harm. But, being cautious, one should note that it is not clear whether the authors have investigated or controlled for the possible role of offline risks in teenagers' lives (classically, as a putative 'third cause' of the observed correlations).

@phdthesis{Erasmus2014,
abstract = {Technology has been an integral part of human life since the 19th century's Industrial Revolution, and the advancement of technologies has continued into the 21st century. Of all new emerging technologies, the computer has been identified as the most important, most complex and fastest emerging technology. In order for businesses to compete and survive within the business world, they are compelled to adopt new computer technologies. However, computers alone cannot improve organisational performance. Computers need to be accepted, optimally used and utilised by employees in order for an organisation to succeed. One such technology is SAP AG's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system which is a real-time, fully integrated business system used by more than 170 000 organisations in 120 countries. Measuring information system success has been a concern since its inception due to its complexity and difficulty to appraise. Researchers traditionally attempted to measure success by the delivering of a functional information system product within certain monetary and time constraints. Subsequently, evidence suggested that a more accurate measure of success lies within the field of system use. One model of assessing and predicting user acceptance and which has gained popularity in recent years is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Apart from accepting the SAP ERP system, users should also be of the intention to continuously use it as a job requirement. The model for measuring user commitment is psychological attachment which determines whether the commitment is insincere and temporary, or long-lasting. Further, not only do users need to accept and continuously use an information technology like SAP ERP; they also need to be able to cope while using it. If not, psychological stress known as techno stress develops and prevents the optimal use of this system. With these three possible explanations for computer technology avoidance as a premise of departure, this study aims to determine the congruence, if any, between the sub-constructs of the TAM (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward using, behavioural intention to use and actual system use), psychological attachment (compliance, identification and internalisation), and techno stress (negative computer thoughts) within a South African SAP ERP user environment. A cross-sectional survey design was used rendering a convenience sample of N = 241 from among the SAP ERP user fraternity at a South African steel manufacturer. The measuring instruments used were the 23-item Technology Acceptance Questionnaire (TAM), the 10-item Psychological Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ) and the 20-item Computer Thoughts Survey (CTS-C). Study 1 which was a literature review confirmed conceptual congruence in that although the technology acceptance model was the most parsimonious, powerful and widely applied theoretical model, it was constrained due to the omission of social influence (psychological attachment) as a contributing factor in the processes of behavioural change towards technology acceptance. Furthermore, it was found that techno stress lowers employee efficiency and creates dissonance in the work environment, resulting in acceptance, hesitance or resistance towards the technology in question. Congruence was established between the system itself (technology acceptance), social relationships (psychological acceptance), and inherent psychological stress (techno stress). The aim of study 2 was to test the technology acceptance model within a South African SAP ERP user environment. Structural equation modelling confirmed that positive inter-construct relationships exist between all TAM constructs. Actual system use, which is the measurement for technology acceptance, was directly affected by behavioural intention to use and indirectly by perceived usefulness. In turn, behavioural intention to use was directly affected by perceived usefulness, attitude toward using and indirectly by perceived ease of use. Attitude toward using was directly affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness was directly affected by perceived ease of use. Study 3 revealed that internalisation had a direct positive effect on behavioural intention to use and an indirect effect on actual system use via behavioural intention to use. Furthermore, in this study identification had direct positive effects on internalisation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and actual system use. Indirect effects emerged between identification and behavioural intention to use via internalisation as well as behavioural intention to use via perceived usefulness. Compliance, on the other hand, had negligible, negative direct effects on all TAM constructs of which the most prominent was that on attitude toward using. Results acquired from structural equation modelling in study four confirmed that weak negative relationships existed between techno stress and all TAM constructs. This finding is contrary to other studies and can be attributed to the fact that participants in this study were at large, proficient around SAP ERP and therefore experienced low levels of techno stress. Furthermore, aspects such as effective training, clear deadlines, effective teamwork, recurrent performance evaluations, job security, career development and realistic job load are all antidotes for techno stress which is believed to be current within the participant fraternity. In a concluding chapter the conclusions derived from the literature review, as well as the empirical research were presented and recommendations flowing from this research study were made.},

abstract = {Many children are spending more time with screen media than has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. There is evidence that parent television use is associated with higher levels of child television time, but we know little about what predicts children's media use with other technology. Using a nationally representative sample of more than 2300 parents of children ages 0-8, children's time spent with four digital media devices - television, computers, smartphones, and tablet computers - was examined. Results from linear regression analyses indicate across all four platforms that parents' own screen time was strongly associated with child screen time. Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental attitudes. Results suggest that policymakers should consider the family environment as a whole when developing policy to influence children's screen media use at home.},

abstract = {This paper draws on an ESRC-funded study of play and creativity in preschool-aged children's use of apps in the UK. The main objectives of the study were to collect information about access to and use of apps in the home, establish the most popular apps and identify the features of those apps that are successful in promoting play and creativity. A mixed-method approach was used to collect data, including video filming of children using the most popular apps. In identifying play types that emerged in the analysis of data, the team utilised an established taxonomy, which outlines sixteen play types. This taxonomy was reviewed and adapted to analyse data from the project relating to digital play. Through this process, an additional type of play, transgressive play, was identified and added to the taxonomy. The paper outlines the implications of the revised taxonomy for future studies of play.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim was to translate, revise, and standardize the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) by Levenstein et al. (1993) in German. The instrument assesses subjectively experienced stress independent of a specific and objective occasion. METHODS Exploratory factor analyses and a revision of the scale content were carried out on a sample of 650 subjects (Psychosomatic Medicine patients, women after delivery, women after miscarriage, and students). Confirmatory analyses and examination of structural stability across subgroups were carried out on a second sample of 1,808 subjects (psychosomatic, tinnitus, inflammatory bowel disease patients, pregnant women, healthy adults) using linear structural equation modeling and multisample analyses. External validation included immunological measures in women who had suffered a miscarriage. RESULTS Four factors (worries, tension, joy, demands) emerged, with 5 items each, as compared with the 30 items of the original PSQ. The factor structure was confirmed on the second sample. Multisample analyses yielded a fair structural stability across groups. Reliability values were satisfactory. Findings suggest that three scales represent internal stress reactions, whereas the scale "demands" relates to perceived external stressors. Significant and meaningful differences between groups indicate differential validity. A higher degree of certain immunological imbalances after miscarriage (presumably linked to pregnancy loss) was found in those women who had a higher stress score. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated in two different treatment samples. CONCLUSION We propose the revised PSQ as a valid and economic tool for stress research. The overall score permits comparison with results from earlier studies using the original instrument.},

abstract = {In a sense, contemporary study of early sociopersonality development includes much that is new as well as old: traditional interests in the social and emotional dimensions of early mother-infant interaction and attachment are broadened and reconceptualized in light of new themes in developmental study as well as insights from allied disciplines. This chapter is meant to capture this dynamic in the context of a research review focused especially on these new directions for the study of traditional topics. This review is admittedly selective; because research on emotional development and temperament are considered in detail in other chapters of the Handbook (Kagan; Rothbart {\&} Bates; Saarni et al.), these topics are given more limited coverage than they deserve in view of their obvious relevance to early sociopersonality functioning. Similarly, issues of emergent peer relations and of the influence of day care are also largely deferred to other Handbook chapters. Despite these caveats, it will be clear that the questions and issues that have traditionally guided inquiry into early sociopersonality development remain provocative, informed by new theoretical views and empirical discoveries, yet also revealing a variety of new problems for future study.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Research on children's use of mobile media devices lags behind its adoption. The objective of this study was to examine young children's exposure to and use of mobile media devices. METHODS Cross-sectional study of 350 children aged 6 months to 4 years seen October to November 2014 at a pediatric clinic in an urban, low-income, minority community. The survey was adapted from Common Sense Media's 2013 nationwide survey. RESULTS Most households had television (97{\%}), tablets (83{\%}), and smartphones (77{\%}). At age 4, half the children had their own television and three-fourths their own mobile device. Almost all children (96.6{\%}) used mobile devices, and most started using before age 1. Parents gave children devices when doing house chores (70{\%}), to keep them calm (65{\%}), and at bedtime (29{\%}). At age 2, most children used a device daily and spent comparable screen time on television and mobile devices. Most 3- and 4-year-olds used devices without help, and one-third engaged in media multitasking. Content delivery applications such as YouTube and Netflix were popular. Child ownership of device, age at first use, and daily use were not associated with ethnicity or parent education. CONCLUSIONS Young children in an urban, low-income, minority community had almost universal exposure to mobile devices, and most had their own device by age 4. The patterns of use suggest early adoption, frequent and independent use, and media multitasking. Studies are urgently needed to update recommendations for families and providers on the use of mobile media by young children.},

The study included a sample of 1072 ICT users (N = 675 nonintensive ICT users and N = 397 intensive ICT users). Results from multigroup confirmatory factor analyses among non-intensive and intensive ICT users showed, as expected, the four-factor structure of technostrain in both samples. Secondly, and also as expected, confirmatory factorial analyses revealed that technostress experiences are characterized not only by technostrain but also by an excessive and compulsive use of ICT. Moreover, multiple analyses of variance showed significant differences between non-intensive and intensive ICT users (1) in the dimensions of technostress and (2) in specific job demands and job/personal resources. Finally, linear multiple regression analyses revealed that technostrain is positively predicted by work overload, role ambiguity, emotional overload, mobbing and obstacles hindering ICT use, as well as by lack of autonomy, transformational leadership, social support, ICT use facilitators and mental competences. Work overload, role ambiguity and mobbing, as well as the lack of emotional competences, positively predict technoaddiction. Theoretical and practical implications, in addition to future research, are discussed.},

The Problematic Internet Use Scale, The Relationship Scale, Subjective Well-Being Scale and Personal Information Form were used in the study. Data were analyzed using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, two-way ANOVA, the Bonferroni test and multiple regression analysis. Results revealed significant correlations among problematic internet use, attachment styles and subjective well-being. Problematic internet use correlated positively with a dismissing attachment style and a preoccupied attachment style. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that gender, subjective well-being and dismissing and preoccupied attachment styles accounted for 19{\%} of total problematic internet use variance. Gender, subjective well-being, and a dismissing attachment style made a significant distinctive contribution to the model.

abstract = {Social networking sites (SNSs) can be beneficial tools for users to gain social capital. Although social capital consists of emotional and informational resources accumulated through interactions with strong or weak social network ties, the existing literature largely ignores attachment style in this context. This study employed attachment theory to explore individuals' attachment orientations toward Facebook usage and toward online and offline social capital. A university student sample (study 1) and a representative national sample (study 2) showed consistent results. Secure attachment was positively associated with online bonding and bridging capital and offline bridging capital. Additionally, secure attachment had an indirect effect on all capital through Facebook time. Avoidant attachment was negatively associated with online bonding capital. Anxious-ambivalent attachment had a direct association with online bonding capital and an indirect effect on all capital through Facebook. Interaction frequency with good friends on Facebook positively predicted all online and offline capital, whereas interaction frequency with average friends on Facebook positively predicted online bridging capital. Interaction frequency with acquaintances on Facebook was negatively associated with offline bonding capital. The study concludes that attachment style is a significant factor in guiding social orientation toward Facebook connections with different ties and influences online social capital. The study extends attachment theory among university students to a national sample to provide more generalizable evidence for the current literature. Additionally, this study extends attachment theory to the SNS setting with a nuanced examination of types of Facebook friends after controlling extraversion. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {A central tenet of John Bowlby's attachment theory is that people's attachment experiences are integrated into so-called 'internal working models'. These working models are supposed to contain representations about 'the world' as well as certain attitudes towards one's self or one's self-concept. In the present study, it is assumed that this self-concept, which reflects the individual's attachment experience, exerts substantial influence on one's self-portrayal in social situations, which is viewed as the process during which the self-concept is communicated to an audience. In the present study the attachment type was determined by the 'Skala zur Erfassung von Bindungsrepr{\"{a}}sentationen' (Scale for the determination of attachment representations) which was developed by Grau (1999). Additionally, the tendency to exhibit 'positive' impression management strategies was measured by the 'Fragebogen zur Erfassung positiver Selbstdarstellung' (Questionnaire for receding positive self-portrayals) by Mummendey and Eifler (1994). Subsequently, people's positive self-portrayal score was compared to their attachment type. Analysis indicated that the attachment type merely had an influence on the tendency to exhibit positive self-portrayal strategies when participants had a negative representation of their-self, as well as a negative representation of others, a pattern which characterises the 'fearful-avoidant' type. Results also demonstrated that elder participants scored lower on the positive self-portrayal scale, irrespective of their attachment type.

Our data suggests that people compensate for interruptions by working faster, but this comes at a price: experiencing more stress, higher frustration, time pressure and effort. Individual differences exist in the management of interruptions: personality measures of openness to experience and need for personal structure predict disruption costs of interruptions. We discuss implications for how system design can support interrupted work},

In this study, a wider perspective is taken by examining almost 2,000 Strange Situation classifications obtained in 8 different countries. Differences and similarities between distributions in classifications of samples are investigated using correspondence analysis. Aggregation of samples per country and continent allowed for a firmer empirical basis for cross-cultural analysis. Substantial intracultural differences were established; in a number of instances, samples from 1 country resembled those in other countries more than they did each other. The data also suggest a pattern of cross-cultural differences, in which A classifications emerge as relatively more prevalent in Western European countries and C classifications as relatively more frequent in Israel and Japan. Intracultural variation was nearly 1.5 times the cross-cultural variation.},

A study that was framed by an ecocultural approach focusing on children's play and learning with toys and technologies is used to illustrate some of the methodological challenges of conducting research with young children in the home. This theoretical framework enabled us to identify and develop a range of methods that illuminated the home's unique mix of inhabitants, learning opportunities and resources and to investigate parents' ethnotheories, or cultural beliefs, that gave rise to the complex of practices, values and attitudes and their intersections with technology and support for learning in the home. This resulted in a better understanding of the role of technology in the lives of these 3- and 4-year-old children.},

Here the specific relations between parental AAI and infant strange situation responses are noted. Next the development of the AAI and of the scoring and classification system are considered from a historical perspective, culminating in a discussion of the greater emphasis now placed upon the analysis of the discourse properties of the interview. These properties were later found to be consonant with the principles of cooperative, rational discourse described by the linguistic philosopher P. Grice (1975, 1989). Third, AAI training institutes and their effects are mentioned briefly. Fourth, a review of present and emerging empirical findings is provided. Finally, several common queries and sources of confusion regarding the AAI and its analysis are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a sample of adult subjects (Study 1), the relative importance and efficacy of extrinsic aspirations for financial success, an appealing appearance, and social recognition were associated with lower vitality and self-actualization and more physical symptoms. Conversely, the relative importance and efficacy of intrinsic aspirations for self-acceptance, affiliation, community feeling, and physical health were associated with higher well-being and less distress. Study 2 replicated these findings in a college sample and extended them to measures of narcissism and daily affect. Three reasons are discussed as to why extrinsic aspirations relate negatively to well-being, and future research directions are suggested.},

abstract = {We contrasted two predictive models of the impact of maternal depressive symptomatology on child behavior in a study of 51 mothers and their conduct-disorder children. Relations between global measures of maternal distress and child adjustment and observational measures of mother-child interaction were examined. Children of distressed mothers were more maladjusted than children of nondistressed mothers, when maladjustment was measured on the basis of a global rating, but "better" adjusted when measured on the basis of interactional measures. Measures of maternal indiscriminate responding to the child may account for these findings. Results suggest that (a) although conduct-disorder children are generally more maladjusted when their mothers are distressed, they display this maladjustment in a selective fashion, and (b) maternal distress acts as an adverse contextual factor that maintains mother-child interactional difficulties by disrupting the attentional and monitoring skills required for contingent responding.},

abstract = {Children use electronic screens at ever younger ages, but there is still little empirical research on how and why parents mediate this media use. In line with Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, we explored whether children's media skills and media activities, next to parents' attitudes about media for children, and several child and parent-family characteristics, predicted parental mediation practices. Furthermore, we investigated children's use and ownership of electronic screens in the bedroom in relationship to the child's media skills. Data from an online survey among 896 Dutch parents with young children (0–7 years) showed that children's use and ownership of TV, game consoles, computers and touchscreens, primarily depended on their media skills and age, not on parent's attitudes about media for children. Only touchscreens were used more often by children, when parents perceived media as helpful in providing moments of rest for the child. In line with former studies, parents consistently applied co-use, supervision, active mediation, restrictive mediation, and monitoring, depending on positive and negative attitudes about media. The child's media skills and media activities, however, had stronger relationships with parental mediation styles, whereas age was not related. Canonical discriminant analysis, finally, captured how the five mediation strategies varied among infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, and early childhood children, predominantly as a result of children's media skills, and media activities, i.e., playing educational games and passive entertainment use.

Among the various components of subjective well-being, the SWLS is narrowly focused to assess global life satisfaction and does not tap related constructs such as positive affect or loneliness. The SWLS is shown to have favorable psychometric properties, including high internal consistency and high temporal reliability. Scores on the SWLS correlate moderately to highly with other measures of subjective well-being, and correlate predictably with specific personality characteristics. It is noted that the SWLS is Suited for use with different age groups, and other potential uses of the scale are discussed.},

In Study 1, 960 participants in Austria completed a German version of the SHS, which showed a unidimensional structure, good internal consistency, and good convergent validity with other measures of subjective well-being. In Study 2, 182 participants in the Philippines completed a Tagalog version of the scale, which likewise had a unidimensional structure, high internal consistency, and good convergent validity. Finally, the results of Study 3 indicate that there were significant cross-cultural differences in subjective happiness. Specifically, participants in individualist Austria and Britain had higher SHS scores than their counterparts in collectivist Malaysia and the Philippines. Limitations of these studies are discussed.},

On the basis of scores from the Achenbach and Edelbrock Child Behavior Profile, an outcome measure of psychopathology at 6 years, the results indicated different outcomes for male and female children. For males, attachment classification at 1 year was significantly related to later psychopathology; insecurely attached males showed more psychopathology than securely attached males. No relationship between attachment and later psychopathology was observed for females. Even for males, the attachment classification only partly predicted later behavioral problems. Several other factors, including life-stress events and family demographic variables, appeared to influence the development of psychopathology. The findings suggest that although the child's attachment relationship plays an important role in the development of psychopathology, the child is neither made invulnerable by an early secure attachment nor doomed to psychopathology by an insecure attachment.},

abstract = {Using an online questionnaire among 1,381 parents (children 0-7 years) in the Netherlands I investigated a) the congruence between the time that parents and children spend on various media; b) how several parent, child and household characteristics vary among four family types: low, moderate, high, and very high media consumers; and c) which characteristics most strongly differentiate these four family types. The analyses reveal that parents vary widely in their media consumption (from about 1 to more than 6½ hours media per day). Since the children's media use parallels their parent's, parents seem to provide an important example in the home. Data also show that lower and higher use families differ significantly on income, education level, number of devices at home, views on media for children, ease of applying co-active mediation and children's proficiency in media use. Finally, the four family types can best be distinguished on the basis of quantity characteristics (education level, number of screens at home, time spent by children on media) and quality characteristics (type of media content used, ease of mediation, views on media for children). Consequences for young children's development and parenting support are described.},

The General PSQ was higher in in-patients than in out-patients (p {\textless} 0.05); both forms were correlated with a somatic complaints scale in a non-patient population (r {\textgreater} 0.5), and were higher, among 27 asymptomatic ulcerative colitis patients, in the seven who had rectal inflammation than in those with normal proctoscopy (p = 0.03).

@techreport{Waller2016,
abstract = {Die JAMES-Studie 2010 erfasst das Medienverhalten von Schweizer Jugendlichen und dient damit als Wissensgrundlage die (Medien-)P{\"{a}}dagogik, die Politik im Bereich der Mediennutzung und Medienkompetenz und weiterf{\"{u}}hrende Forschung. {\"{U}}ber 1‘000 Jugendliche im Alter von 12 bis 19 Jahren wurden mittels Fragebogen im Klassenverband befragt. Die Stichprobe ist repr{\"{a}}sentativ in Bezug auf die Grundgesamtheit und l{\"{a}}sst Vergleiche zwischen Subgruppen zu. Hierbei wurde der Fokus auf Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern, zwischen vier Altersgruppen und zwischen den drei gr{\"{o}}ssten Sprachregionen der Schweiz (Deutschschweiz, Romandie und Tessin) gelegt. Ebenso wurden drei Stufen des sozialen Status, der Urbanit{\"{a}}tsgrad des Wohnortes der Befragten (st{\"{a}}dtisch oder l{\"{a}}ndlich), die Herkunft (Schweizer oder Migrationshintergrund) und bei einer Teilstichprobe, drei verschiedene Schultypen miteinander verglichen. Neben den allgemeinen Freizeitaktivit{\"{a}}ten, nonmedial und medial, wurden die Bereiche Computer und Internet, mit einem Augenmerk auf die Social Networks erhoben. Des Weiteren wurde die Nutzung von Handy und Videogames n{\"{a}}her betrachtet. Es zeigt sich, dass die Schweizer Jugendlichen eine aktive und individuelle Freizeitgestaltung pflegen, mit und ohne Medien. Mit hoher technischer Kompetenz bewegen sie sich im Internet und den Social Networks und nutzen ausgiebig diverse Funktionen des Hybridmediums Handy. Auf der Basis der differenzierten Daten lassen sich inad{\"{a}}quater Medienumgang von Heranwachsenden ermitteln und Ansatzpunkte zur Pr{\"{a}}vention ableiten. Die Schweizer Jugendlichen pflegen einen aktiven Umgang mit Medien. Dennoch zeigen die vorliegenden Daten auf, dass es keine allgemein g{\"{u}}ltige Beschreibung f{\"{u}}r das Medienverhalten des Schweizer Jugendlichen gibt. In diversen Bereichen unterscheidet sich die Mediennutzung der Heranwachsenden zum Beispel in den drei Sprachregionen stark voneinander. Vor dem Hintergrund des jeweiligen Kulturraumes sind Interpretationen nur mit Bedacht zu machen. Gr{\"{u}}nde f{\"{u}}r solche Abweichungen zu finden erfordert eine ausf{\"{u}}hrliche Untersuchung mit Fokus auf diesen Bereich. Zwischen den Geschlechtern, den Altersgruppen, etc. finden sich Differenzen, welche teilweise durch unterschiedliche Zug{\"{a}}nge oder andersartige Mediensozialisation erkl{\"{a}}rbar sind. Wichtig ist im Hinterkopf zu behalten, dass es keinen einheitlichen Umgang mit Medien gibt, wenn {\"{u}}ber Jugendliche in der Schweiz gesprochen wird. So sollte diese Vielfalt in der P{\"{a}}dagogik und auch in der Politik ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. In ihrer Freizeit gehen die Befragten sowohl medialen, in erster Linie mit Handy und Internet, als auch nonmedialen Aktivit{\"{a}}ten intensiv nach, wie z.B. Verabredungen mit Freunden oder sportlichen Bet{\"{a}}tigungen. Das multifunktionale Mobiltelefon und der Computer sind nahezu fl{\"{a}}chendeckend in den Haushalten vorhanden und werden auch rege genutzt. Die technische Computer-Kompetenz ist hoch - insbesondere bei den Knaben – und sie steigt mit dem Alter weiter an. Die Jugendlichen wissen wie sie Computer und Internet gezielt einsetzen k{\"{o}}nnen, um sich Informationen zu beschaffen, unterhalten zu werden und Pflichten nach zu gehen f{\"{u}}r Schule und Arbeit. Insbesondere die Art der Informationsbeschaffung im Internet scheint interessanten Ver{\"{a}}nderungesprozessen unterworfen zu sein, neben den klassischen Suchmaschinen wie Google werden vermehrt auch Social Networks dazu genutzt. Dies w{\"{u}}rde die These untermauern, dass z.B. Facebook als eine spezifische Form einer «Tageszeitung» f{\"{u}}r das Geschehen im sozialen Umfeld genutzt wird. Ein grosser Teil der Befragten ist auf Social Networks vertreten, ein Vergleich mit den publizierten Nutzerzahlen8 der Plattform-Anbieter zeigt aber, dass diese Angaben mit Vorsicht zu geniessen sind. So kursiert zum Beispiel f{\"{u}}r das Jahr 2009 die Zahl von 333‘400 Schweizer Facebooknutzer in der Altergruppe 14- bis 17 Jahre. Das w{\"{a}}ren bei einer Gesamtzahl von 353‘4009 Einwohnern in dieser Altersgruppe ein Anteil von 94.3 {\%}, die {\"{u}}ber einen Facebook Account verf{\"{u}}gen. Diese Zahl ist offenbar zu hoch und wird durch Doppelaccounts oder falschen Altersangaben etc. verf{\"{a}}lscht. Mit einem Blick auf die Ergebnisse aus dem Kapitel Videogames ist zu erkennen, dass der typische Videogamer m{\"{a}}nnlich, eher j{\"{u}}nger ist und in der s{\"{u}}dlichen Schweiz wohnt. Mehr als zwei Drittel der Gamer haben schon Videogames gespielt, f{\"{u}}r die sie eigentlich zu jung waren. Hier besteht Handlungsbedarf im Hinblick auf den verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Videogames. Von Heranwachsenden im Alter von 12 Jahren ist ein solcher nicht zu erwarten, sie ben{\"{o}}tigen dazu Unterst{\"{u}}tzung ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, seien dies Eltern, Lehrer oder andere Vertrauenspersonen. Dies setzt voraus, dass diese sich auf die Welt der Videogames einlassen, und im besten Falle selbst einmal einen Controller in die Hand nehmen oder sich in ein Online-Game einloggen. An dieser Stelle sei ein Hinweis auf die PEGI-Kriterien10 erlaubt, welche sowohl Altersangaben als auch Inhaltskriterien zur Begr{\"{u}}ndung der Altersempfehlung aufweisen. «In der Schweiz haben sich die Hersteller von Games sowie der Handel freiwillig einem 'Code of Conduct' unterstellt. Dieser aktive Jugendschutz soll Alterskontrollen an den Kassen sicherstellen und sieht Werbeeinschr{\"{a}}nkungen vor. Ausserdem verpflichtet er den H{\"{a}}ndler auch dazu, nur Spiele zu verkaufen, die durch das PEGI-Rating gekennzeichnet sind» (PEGI. Pan European Game Information, 2010). Daran k{\"{o}}nnen sich sowohl Nutzerinnen und Nutzer als auch die Erziehungsverantwortlichen orientieren. Ebenfalls hilfreich sind die Hinweise der Positivpr{\"{a}}dikatisierung (siehe www.bupp.at). Als letztes sollen die Erkenntnisse zum Handy zusammengefasst werden, welches als das aktuell wichtigste Jugendmedium bezeichnet werden kann. Es wird h{\"{a}}ufig genutzt, pr{\"{a}}feriert wird dabei die SMS-Funktion, noch vor dem Telefonieren. Daneben sind eine Reihe von weiteren Funktionen wie der integrierte Musikplayer oder die Kamera beliebt bei den Jugendlichen. Problematisch wird die Handynutzung dann, wenn mit dieser Kamera z.B. Schl{\"{a}}gereien gefilmt werden oder mit Hilfe des Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) Pornofilme verschickt werden. Dieses Problem ist insbesondere unter den Knaben verbreitet, da es im Altersverlauf keine Zunahme gibt, ist es wichtig in der Pr{\"{a}}ventionsarbeit sehr fr{\"{u}}h, also um das zw{\"{o}}lfte Lebensjahr mit Aufkl{\"{a}}rung und Interventionsarbeit anzusetzen und diese auch geschlechtsspezifisch zu gestalten. Wie unterscheidet sich die Lage der Schweiz allgemein von Deutschland? Obwohl in der deutschen JIM-Studie (mpfs, 2010) mit der telefonischen Befragung eine andere Erhebungs-Methode verwendet wird, sind die Ergebnisse in vielen Bereichen sehr {\"{a}}hnlich. Interessanterweise gibt es zwar l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede zwischen Deutschland und der Schweiz, wird jedoch nur die Deutschschweiz in diesen L{\"{a}}ndervergleich miteinbezogen, so werden diese um einiges geringer. Die Deutschschweizer Jugendlichen sind ihren deutschen Nachbarn in bestimmten Bereichen also n{\"{a}}her als ihren Landesgenossen in der lateinischen Schweiz (z.B. in der aktiven Gestaltung von Content im Internet oder der Aktivierung von Privatsph{\"{a}}re-Einstellungen in Social Networks). Wie bereits erw{\"{a}}hnt k{\"{o}}nnen sprachkulturelle Gegebenheiten Ursache f{\"{u}}r diese Unterschiede sein, wobei die deutschschweizer Medien- Kultur der deutschen offensichtlich n{\"{a}}her ist als derjenigen der Romands und Tessiner. Zusammengefasst unterscheiden sich die beiden L{\"{a}}nder kaum in der Freizeitgestaltung, lediglich die Geschlechtsunterschiede sind in der Schweiz pr{\"{a}}gnanter. Das TV-Programm wird in Deutschland noch {\"{o}}fters {\"{u}}ber das Fernsehger{\"{a}}t rezipiert, die Schweizer schauen dagegen mehr TV-Sendungen {\"{u}}bers Internet. Ebenso werden Radio, B{\"{u}}cher und der Computer ohne Internetzugang in Deutschland h{\"{a}}ufiger genutzt. In der Schweiz haben drei von vier Jugendlichen einen eigenen Computer zur Verf{\"{u}}gung, das ist ein Viertel mehr als in Deutschland. Diese werden hierzulande f{\"{u}}r Schule oder Lehre h{\"{a}}ufiger eingesetzt. Die j{\"{u}}ngste Schweizer Altersgruppe nutzt denn auch den Computer und das Internet {\"{o}}fter zur Unterhaltung als ihre gleichaltrigen Nachbarn aus Deutschland. Den Zugang zu Informationen beschaffen sich deutsche und Schweizer Jugendliche sehr unterschiedlich. Ebenso unterscheiden sich die Pr{\"{a}}ferenzen von Social Networks zwischen den L{\"{a}}ndern, wie auch die Respektierung der Privatsph{\"{a}}re anderer, diese wird in der Schweiz eher gewahrt, es werden also weniger Fotos oder Videos von anderen Personen ohne deren Zustimmung ins Internet gestellt. Im Bereich der Videogames und der Handynutzung gibt es kaum l{\"{a}}nderspezifische Unterschiede. Insgesamt weisen die Befragten ein hohes Mass an Individualit{\"{a}}t und ein breites Spektrum an Interessen auf. Handlungsbedarf besteht bei der bewussteren Auswahl der Videogames nach PEGI-Kriterien, wobei hier insbesondere auch die erwachsenen Bezugspersonen zur Verantwortung gezogen werden m{\"{u}}ssen. Ebenso sollte der Umgang mit problematischen Inhalten auf dem Handy thematisiert werden, dies am besten in der Schule und zwar bereits auf Primarschulstufe. In Zeiten von WikiLeaks sind jegliche Informationen im World Wide Web potentiell zug{\"{a}}nglich. Jugendliche sollten hinreichend {\"{u}}ber die Konsequenzen von zu offenem Umgang mit privaten Informationen aufgekl{\"{a}}rt werden, dies gilt insbesondere f{\"{u}}r die J{\"{u}}ngsten, welche am wenigsten von der M{\"{o}}glichkeit Gebrauch machen, ihre Privatsph{\"{a}}re in Social Networks zu sch{\"{u}}tzen. Des Weiteren ist zu betonen, dass dieses Wissen, das sich die Digital Natives schon in ihren fr{\"{u}}hen Lebensjahren aneignen weiterhin gef{\"{o}}rdert werden soll. Unterst{\"{u}}tzt vom Allgemeinwissen ihrer erwachsenen Bezugspersonen, die ihnen die gesellschaftlichen, gesundheitlichen und moralischen Aspekte des Medienhandelns aufzeigen k{\"{o}}nnen und ihnen auch einen produktiven Umgang, selbstverantwortliches Handeln und die n{\"{o}}tige Abgrenzung vorleben sollten. Wie eingangs erw{\"{a}}hnt, verfolgen wir das Ziel, in der Schweiz ebenfalls},

abstract = {Animal studies indicate that early maternal care has long-term effects on brain areas related to social attachment and parenting, whereas neglectful mothering is linked with heightened stress reactivity in the hippocampus across the lifespan. The present study explores the possibility, using magnetic resonance imaging, that perceived quality of maternal care in childhood is associated with brain structure and functional responses to salient infant stimuli among human mothers in the first postpartum month. Mothers who reported higher maternal care in childhood showed larger grey matter volumes in the superior and middle frontal gyri, orbital gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. In response to infant cries, these mothers exhibited higher activations in the middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, whereas mothers reporting lower maternal care showed increased hippocampal activations. These findings suggest that maternal care in childhood may be associated with anatomy and functions in brain regions implicated in appropriate responsivity to infant stimuli in human mothers.},

abstract = {This study compared the amount and style of maternal communication with toddlers and preschoolers while mother–child pairs watched TV, read books, and played with toys. We found that mother–child communication was less frequent and less verbally responsive when dyads viewed TV compared with when they read books, and in many cases, when they played with toys. In addition, some forms of maternal responsiveness were positively associated with indicators of youngsters' emergent literacy. Mothers' use of directive language was negatively related to emergent literacy. These findings suggest that TV co-viewing produces a relatively detrimental communication environment for young children, while shared book reading encourages effective mother–child exchanges.},

The purpose of the study was to explore the nature, purpose, and role of literacy in children's use of a virtual world. In this article, I reflect on how children's use of literacy practices in the virtual world constructed and maintained an online social order. One hundred seventy-five children in an English primary school completed an online survey from which their use of virtual worlds was examined. Individual and group interviews were then conducted with 26 children across the year. The interviews established that children used the virtual worlds to extend contact with peers they had regular interaction with in the offline world. Further, three 11-year-old children were filmed at home as they used the virtual world Club Penguin. Additional interviews were conducted with the three children and their parents. Data analysis focused on the ways in which children drew on specific literacy practices to construct and maintain an interaction order. A key finding is that literacy operates as a means of developing online social cohesion, but the literacy practices that serve this function are located within the social, material, and cultural structures in which the children operate in the offline world and thus cannot be viewed in isolation from these wider discourses.},

abstract = {This paper offers a new characterisation of young children's (2–8 years) reading for pleasure (RfP) with digital books. This characterisation is rooted in a re-contextualisation of Anna Craft's conceptualisation of twenty-first century childhoods in Creativity and education futures (Stoke on Trent, Trentham, 2011) and a review of the literature concerning young children's RfP with digital books. The paper develops Craft's (2011) work by considering the ways in which digital books can resource the ‘4Ps of digital childhood' in reading for pleasure. Six facets of reader engagement, nested within Craft's (2011) 4Ps, are presented: affective, creative, interactive, shared, sustained and personalised reading engagements. It is argued that this characterisation of young children's reading engagements can enrich our understanding of the affordances of digital books in relation to RfP in the twenty-first century. The paper thus offers an important new contribution, going beyond established work in the field, which typically explores digital books in relation to children's learning, product design or developmental outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education},

Data analysis focuses on the complex interplay between the story-book app's interactive features and the children's responses to them. Our findings show that interactive elements increase the child's autonomy, as they tend to promote the importance of the reader, positioning him or her as a collaborator, storyteller, an author or an internal character in the fiction; something that can materialise in exciting narrative strategies that can trigger powerful responses to digital literary texts in emergent readers, including playing, creating new fictions or engaging emotionally with the story. Fi-nally, we argue that the Reader Response models that have been used over recent decades to understand children's reading experiences with storybooks need to be revised to better understand their current expe-riences with interactive texts.},

Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/ stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lack of adherence to diabetic self-management regimens is associated with a high risk of diabetes complications. Previous research has shown that the quality of the patient-provider relationship is associated with adherence to diabetes treatment. This study attempts to improve understanding of both patient and provider factors involved in lack of adherence to treatment in diabetic patients by using the conceptual model of attachment theory. METHOD: Instruments that assessed attachment, treatment adherence, depression, diabetes severity, patient-provider communication, and demographic data were administered to 367 patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes in a health maintenance organization primary care setting. Glucose control, medical comorbidity, and adherence to medications and clinic appointments were determined from automated data. Analyses of covariance were used to determine if attachment style and quality of patient-provider communication were associated with adherence to treatment. RESULTS: Patients who exhibited dismissing attachment had significantly worse glucose control than patients with preoccupied or secure attachment. An interaction between attachment and communication quality was significantly associated with glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) levels. Among the patients with a dismissing attachment style, there was a significant difference in glycosylated hemoglobin levels between those who rated their patient-provider communication as poor (mean=8.50{\%}, SD=1.55{\%}) and those who rated this communication as good (mean=7.49{\%}, SD=1. 33{\%}). Among all patients who were taking oral hypoglycemics, adherence to medications and glucose monitoring was significantly worse in patients who exhibited dismissing attachment and rated their patient-provider communication as poor. CONCLUSIONS: Dismissing attachment in the setting of poor patient-provider communication is associated with poorer treatment adherence in patients with diabetes},

abstract = {The quality of life (QOL) construct has a complex composition, so it is not surprising that there is neither an agreed definition nor a standard form of measurement. This is not due to a lack of ideas. The Directory of Instruments (http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/acqol/instruments/index.htm), produced by the Australian Centre on Quality of Life, describes over 800 instruments which purport to measure life quality in some form, with each one containing an idiosyncratic mixture of dependent variables. It is notable, however, that many of these instruments have been developed for highly selected groups in the population; particularly in regard to scales devised to monitor QOL in the context of medical conditions or disability. Such scales are unsuitable for use with the general population. Moreover, most scales devised for use with the general population cannot be used with all population sub-sets, such as people with cognitive impairment and children. These are important limitations since it means that the QOL experienced by minority groups cannot be norm-referenced back to the general population. A further concern is that many QOL instruments fail to make a clear distinction between the objective and subjective dimensions of life quality. This violates the fundamental principle that objective and subjective dimensions are separate entities that normally bear little or no relationship to one another, and so must be separately measured. With these issues in mind, the Personal Wellbeing Index has been developed to measure the subjective dimension of QOL – Subjective Wellbeing.},

abstract = {Self-report measures of adult attachment are typically scored in ways (e.g., averaging or summing items) that can lead to erroneous inferences about important theoretical issues, such as the degree of continuity in attachment security and the differential stability of insecure attachment patterns. To determine whether existing attachment scales suffer from scaling problems, the authors conducted an item response theory (IRT) analysis of 4 commonly used self-report inventories: Experiences in Close Relationships scales (K. A. Brennan, C. L. Clark, {\&} P. R. Shaver, 1998), Adult Attachment Scales (N. L. Collins {\&} S. J. Read, 1990), Relationship Styles Questionnaire (D. W. Griffin {\&} K. Bartholomew, 1994) and J. Simpson's (1990) attachment scales. Data from 1,085 individuals were analyzed using F. Samejima's (1969) graded response model. The authors' findings indicate that commonly used attachment scales can be improved in a number of important ways. Accordingly, the authors show how IRT techniques can be used to develop new attachment scales with desirable psychometric properties.},

abstract = {Research into positive aspects of the psyche is growing as psychologists learn more about the protective role of positive processes in the development and course of mental disorders, and about their substantial role in promoting mental health. With increasing globalization, there is strong interest in studies examining positive constructs across cultures. To obtain valid cross-cultural comparisons, measurement invariance for the scales assessing positive constructs has to be established. The current study aims to assess the cross-cultural measurement invariance of questionnaires for 6 positive constructs: Social Support (Fydrich, Sommer, Tydecks, {\&} Br{\"{a}}hler, 2009), Happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky {\&} Lepper, 1999), Life Satisfaction (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, {\&} Griffin, 1985), Positive Mental Health Scale (Lukat, Margraf, Lutz, van der Veld, {\&} Becker, 2016), Optimism (revised Life Orientation Test [LOT-R]; Scheier, Carver, {\&} Bridges, 1994) and Resilience (Schumacher, Leppert, Gunzelmann, Strauss, {\&} Br{\"{a}}hler, 2004). Participants included German (n = 4,453), Russian (n = 3,806), and Chinese (n = 12,524) university students. Confirmatory factor analyses and measurement invariance testing demonstrated at least partial strong measurement invariance for all scales except the LOT-R and Subjective Happiness Scale. The latent mean comparisons of the constructs indicated differences between national groups. Potential methodological and cultural explanations for the intergroup differences are discussed.},

However, we know little about what factors predict parents' co-use across the multiple types of media technology families own. Using a US nationally representative sample of 2,326 parents of children aged 8 and under, this study examines factors associated with parent–child co-use across six types of media: books, TV, computers, video games, tablets, and smartphones. Results indicate that parents are more likely to co-use traditional media such as books and television, whereas they are least likely to co-use video games. Results also suggest that media co-use may be a function of parental availability and parents' time spent with media, as well as parent demographics such as parents' age, gender, ethnicity, and level of education, and child demographics such as child age and gender. Results have implications for creating more targeted parental interventions to encourage media co-use.},

The analyses reveal that the parents' experiences of problems is associated with negative views on media effects, the presence of older siblings living at home and occur especially when their child is active on social media. Parents' feelings of competence are enhanced by positive views on media effects, older children being present in the home, and the involvement of the young child in educational games and media skill level. Parents feel less confident if their child is active on social media. Support is primarily dependent on the level of problems at hand. Moreover, professionals are consulted especially when parents feel less competent, their child is active on social media and no older siblings are present at home. Parents ask family or friends for advice when they have a negative view on media effects.},

To date, the new science of relationships has been dominated by data. This article is based on the conviction that progress now hinges on the development of theory to organize and interpret extant findings and to guide future investigations. Through a selective but extensive review of the major bodies of empirical literature, we attempt to show that attachment theory can incorporate a broad range of findings on adult relationships. In addition, attachment theory addresses an impressive array of research questions concerning the functions, emotional dynamics, evolutionary origins, and developmental pathways of human affectional bonds. We conclude that a comprehensive theory of close relationships is both desirable and, with the integration of existing theories and concepts, currently achievable.},

Secure attachment was positively associated with online bonding and bridging capital and offline bridging capital. Additionally, secure attachment had an indirect effect on all capital through Facebook time. Avoidant attachment was negatively associated with online bonding capital.

Model 1 posits that attachment representations consist of a single global working model summarizing attachment across specific relationships and domains. Model 2 proposes three independent working models for the relationship domains of family, platonic friend-ships, and romantic partners. Model 3 postulates that specific relationship models are nested under relationship domain repre-sentations that are, in turn, nested under an overarching global working model. Participants completed standard attachment scales for the relationship domains of family, platonic friend-ships, and romantic partners and also provided attachment rat-ings for three specific relationships within each domain. As expected, confirmatory factor analyses showed that Model 3 attained the best fit, regardless of analysis strategy, measurement strategy, gender, and relationship status.

abstract = {Obesity has become a worldwide public health problem. Considerable research has shown that the media contribute to the development of child and adolescent obesity, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Screen time may displace more active pursuits, advertising of junk food and fast food increases children's requests for those particular foods and products, snacking increases while watching TV or movies, and late-night screen time may interfere with getting adequate amounts of sleep, which is a known risk factor for obesity. Sufficient evidence exists to warrant a ban on junk-food or fast-food advertising in children's TV programming. Pediatricians need to ask 2 questions about media use at every well-child or well-adolescent visit: (1) How much screen time is being spent per day? and (2) Is there a TV set or Internet connection in the child's bedroom?},

Um individuelle Unterschiede in den Bindungsrepr{\"{a}}sentationen zu erfassen, liegen einige Me{\ss}instrumente aus dem amerikanischen Sprachraum vor. Aus diesen Quellen wurde ein Fragebogen erstellt, der einige Probleme vermeidet, insbesondere was niedrige Reliabilit{\"{a}}t und das gleichzeitige Ansprechen verschiedener Bindungspersonen innerhalb einer Skala angeht. Es wurden zwei intern konsistente, voneinander unabh{\"{a}}ngige Skalen aus je 10 Items erstellt, die Angst und Vermeidung als zwei Dimensionen der Bindungsunsicherheit erfassen. Eine sichere Bindung ergibt sich aus einer niedrigen Auspr{\"{a}}gung in beiden Skalen. Die Skalen h{\"{a}}ngen mit der Beziehungsqualit{\"{a}}t zusammen.},
